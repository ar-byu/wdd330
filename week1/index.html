    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>One note for this week: I had a little bit of trouble figuring out how to create each 'a' element in the Javascript. 
        MDN Web Docs and StackOverflow to the rescue! In all seriousness though, I only had to look it up for review after two months 
        of not working on HTML and Javascript. I doubt I'll have to look up something like that again.</p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the biggest difference between localStorage and cookies? Why does it matter which one you use?</li>
    </ol>
