    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <h2>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h2>
    <p>There are generally three types of errors; system error, programmer error, and user error. A system error occurs when there is a
        problem with the system or external devices that the program interacts with. These are generally difficult for the programmer to
        fix, as they do not work directly with whatever is causing the root of the problem. Programmer errors happen when the program 
        contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic. Programmer errors are the responsibility of the programmer to resolve. User errors
        happen when the user has entered data incorrectly, in a way the program can't handle. We can avoid user errors by making the program
        able to handle as many errors as it can.
    </p>
    <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value which the programmer can use to resolve the error. For example, trying to call
        a method that does not exist will result in an exception. An exception also produces what is called a stack trace. A stack trace works
        back to where the error originated, which is helpful when you aren't exactly sure where the error occured.
    </p>
    <p>A warning occurs when there's an error that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. While an error that doesn't make the program crash
        doesn't sound like a big deal, it should still be amended as quickly as possible, as it could made the program continue to run
        incorrectly.
    </p>
    <p>When a runtime error occurs in a browser, the HTML will still appear, but the Javascript in the background with stop functioning.
        If a warning occurs, Javascript will continue to run, but it will likely not function correctly. Obviously, you will want to debug 
        and test as much as you can so that this doesn't happen.
    </p>
    <h2>The Importance of Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <p>Because of the way Javascript works, it doesn't always alert the user to errors in the program, and continues to run incorrectly. This
        can be called "failing silently" and is something to avoid. Failing silently means errors are harder to trace and fix.
    </p>
    <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
    <p>Strict mode is a feature that allows for programmers to spot errors more quickly. It also throws exceptions when sloppy code practices
        are used, therefore enforcing cleaner, better quality code. To use strict mode, all one must do is add a string at the beginning of
        their Javascript; 'use strict'. This will be picked up by any Javascript engine that supports strict mode, and will be ignored by
        engines that do not support it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to using strict mode for an entire file, you can also use strict mode for only the contents
        of a function by putting 'use strict' at the beginning of whatever is inside the function. The recommended way to invoke strict mode is
        to place it at the beginning of what is called a self-invoking function, which contains all code. This is good practice because placing 
        'use strict' at the beginning of a file will enforce strict mode on <i>all</i> code in the file, including imported code that might not
        have been written in strict mode. Using a self-invoking function ensures that only your code is written in strict mode.
    </p>
    <h2>Linting Tools</h2>
    <p>
        Linting tools are a way of testing the quality of Javascript code beyond the use of strict mode. Linting tools look for sloppy practice,
        syntax errors, and certain style conventions like indenting. They are good tools for enforcing a style guide, therefore making sure that
        everyone on a team is following the same conventions. There are several ways to implement a linting tool; you can paste your code into an
        online tool, use a text editor plugin, or install linting software directly to your computer.
    </p>
    <h2>Feature Detection</h2>
    <p>
        Javascript has many APIs that not all browsers will support. A programmer can make sure that the browser supports any API they might be 
        using by using an if statement before using anything from the API. This will ensure that no errors occur if the browser doesn't support
        the method being used.
    </p>
    <h2>Debugging in the Browser</h2>
    <p>
        Debugging in the process of finding where bugs occur, then dealing with them. Many times, the place where the bug occurs is not where it 
        originated, so you will have to run different parts of the code to figure out where the bug originated. Using breakpoints is a critical
        step in figuring out where the bug originates. By setting a breakpoint, you are then able to execute code line by line, allowing you to
        see where a bug starts.
    </p>
    <p>One of the most basic forms of debugging in Javascript is to use an alert to show dialog at certain points in the code. An alert stops the
        code from running until the alert is dismissed and is an effective breakpoint when you need to check that a variable has the expected 
        value. for example.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another good way of debugging is to use console.log. This is one that I've used very often to make sure that things are running as they
        should.
    </p>
    <h2>Debugging Tools</h2>
    <p>Most modern browsers have a built-in debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints that will pause the code. You can then see the
        values of all the variables and modify them as needed. You can also use the debugger command to make the browser's debugging function
        kick in. 
    </p>
    <h2>Error Objects</h2>
    <p>
        An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or can be created using a constructor. This constructor
        function takes a parameter that is then used as an error message. There are seven more error objects; EvalError, which is used mostly
        in backwards compatability and was used to identify errors in the global eval() function, RangeError, when a number is outside an 
        allowable range of values, ReferenceError, when a reference is made to a non-existent item, SyntaxError, when there is a problem with the
        program's syntax, TypeError, when there is an error in the type of value used, URIError, when there is a problem encoding or decoding the
        URI, and InternalError, when an error with the Javascript engine occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        These errors can also be used to create custom error objects, and therefore custom error messages.
    </p>
    <h2>Throwing Exceptions</h2>
    <p>It's possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement. This will cause a program to stop. It is considered best practice to
        throw an error with a message.
    </p>
    <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
    <p>
        Handling exceptions is good practice during production, as it makes the program more polished. Exceptions can be identified while remaining
        hidden from the user, and from there, can be either dealt with or ignored. Handling exceptions keeps the program running. A good way to
        handle exceptions is to use try-catch-finally. Try gives the program something to start with, catch tells what to do in the event that the
        code in the try statement throws an exception, and finally tells the program what to do after both the try and catch statements are done.
    </p>
    <h2>Tests</h2>
    <p>
        Testing is an important, and sometimes overlooked, part of programming. Writing good tests ensures that the code is less likely to break,
        and errors are dealt with early on. In the same vein, test-driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests before the actual code,
        then adding code to be tested, and polish the tests to make it more readable and efficient. In TDD, the code is tested at every stage to
        ensure that it works. TDD is the best practice, in theory, but is not often used in favor of time management.
    </p>
    <p>
        Testing frameworks provide structure to write meaningful tests and run them, saving the programmer the tedium of having to write each test
        by hand. One popular testing framework is called Jest, and was made by Facebook. Running Jest will return the results of whatever tests
        are being run.
