    <h2>Client-Side Validation</h2>
    <form>
        <label for="required">Required:</label>
        <input type="text" name="required" required>
        <label for="specific">Specific Format:</label>
        <input type="tel" name="specific" pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{3}">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    <p>Hitting "submit" without filling a required field or meeting a specific pattern will cause some form of notification to pop up, prompting
        the user to re-enter whatever they put in. This is an easy way to make sure that the data being sent meets certain specifications, but it
        can also be circumvented. This is why server-side validation is important, too. You could also use Javascript to validate forms, if you
        would prefer that.
    </p>
    <p>Built-in form validation uses HTML attributes such as required, min-length, max-length, type, and pattern. To make required or invalid
        inputs more visible, you can style them in CSS by using the :valid and :invalid tags.
    </p>
    <p>Validating a form via Javascript means using the Constraint Validation API. It has the following properties for certain form elements:</p>
    <p>
        validationMessage: Returns a localized message describing the validation constraints that the control doesn't satisfy (if any). <br>
        validity: Returns a ValidityState object that contains several properties describing the validity state of the element.<br>
            patternMismatch: Returns true if the value does not match the specified pattern, and false if it does match.<br>
            tooLong: Returns true if the value is longer than the maximum length specified by the maxlength attribute, or false if it is shorter than or equal to the maximum.<br>
            tooShort: Returns true if the value is shorter than the minimum length specified by the minlength attribute, or false if it is greater than or equal to the minimum.<br>
            rangeOverflow: Returns true if the value is greater than the maximum specified by the max attribute, or false if it is less than or equal to the maximum.<br>
            rangeUnderflow: Returns true if the value is less than the minimum specified by the min attribute, or false if it is greater than or equal to the minimum.<br>
            typeMismatch: Returns true if the value is not in the required syntax (when type is email or url), or false if the syntax is correct.<br>
            valid: Returns true if the element meets all its validation constraints, and is therefore considered to be valid, or false if it fails any constraint.<br>
            valueMissing: Returns true if the element has a required attribute, but no value, or false otherwise.<br>
        willValidate: Returns true if the element will be validated when the form is submitted; false otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>Contraint Validation API also has several methods:</p>
    <p>
        checkValidity(): Returns true if the element's value has no validity problems; false otherwise. If the element is invalid, this method also fires an invalid event on the element.<br>
        reportValidity(): Reports invalid field(s) using events. Useful in combination with preventDefault() in an onSubmit event handler<br>
        setCustomValidity(message): Adds a custom error message to the element; if you set a custom error message, the element is considered to be invalid, and the specified error is displayed. This lets you use JavaScript code to establish a validation failure other than those offered by the standard HTML validation constraints. The message is shown to the user when reporting the problem.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Supplying Request Options</h2>
    <p>The fetch() method takes an optional second parameter, an init object that allows you to change several different settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Method</li>
        <li>Mode</li>
        <li>Cache</li>
        <li>Credentials</li>
        <li>Headers
            <ul>
                <li>Content Type</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Redirect</li>
        <li>ReferrerPolicy</li>
        <li>Body</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Question: How much of the init object are we expected to use in this course?</p>
