    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>A cookie is a name-value pair associated with a given website and stored on the computer that runs the browser. Once a cookie is set by
        a website, all future page requests to that site have access to that cookie until the cookie expires or becomes out of date. Websites
        cannot access cookies not set by themselves, making cookies more secure than most people think.
    </p>
    <p>A cookie's life cycle is as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>A web browser requests a URL that corresponds to a PHP script. Within that script is a function to set a cookie.</li>
            <li>The page produced by the PHP script is sent back to the browser, along with an HTTP set-cookie header that contains the name
                and value of the cookie to be set.
            </li>
            <li>When it receives this header, the browser creates and stores a value as a cookie with the given name.</li>
            <li>Subsequent page requests to that website contain an HTTP cookie header that sends the name/value pair to the script requested.</li>
            <li>Upon receipt of a page request with a cookie header, PHP automatically creates an entry in the $_COOKIE array with the name of
                the cookie and its value.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The PHP setcookie function lets you set a variable that will be automatically set by subsequent page requests from the same browser.</p>
    <p>The setcookie function must be called before any of the actual page content is set, or else it will cause an error.</p>
    <p>The only required parameter for setcookie is the cookie's name. However, calling setcookie with only the name will delete the cookie that's
        stored in the browser, if it exists. The value parameter allows you to create a new cookie or modify an existing one.
    </p>
    <p>By default, cookies are stored in the browser, and thus will continue to be sent with page requests until the browser is closed. In
        order to keep a cookie after the browser is closed, you need to set the expiryTime parameter to specify the number of seconds from
        January 1, 1970 to the time at which you want to automatically delete the cookie. The current time in this format can be obtained using
        the PHP time function. To set a cookie to expire in one hour, you could use time() + 3600. To delete a cookie with a preset expiry time,
        change the expiry time to represent a point in the past.
    </p>
    <p>The path parameter of the setcookie function lets you restrict cookie access to a certain path on the server. For example, you could use
        '/admin/' as a cookie path to limit use of that cookie to only admin directories.
    </p>
    <p>The domain parameter has a similar purpose to parameter. It restricts the cookie's access to a given domain. By default, a cookie will be
        returned only to the host it was originally sent from. However, sometimes you have several host websites for a web presence (for example,
        google.com and images.google.com). To create a cookie that's accessible by pages on both servers, you would set the domain parameter to
        '.google.com'.
    </p>
    <p>The secure parameter, when set to 1, indicates that a cookie should only be sent with page requests that happen over a secure connection;
        a URL that starts with https instead of http.
    </p>
    <p>The httpOnly parameter, when set to 1, tells the browser to prevent Javascript code from seeing the cookie being created.</p>
    <p>While all parameters but name are optional, you have to specify values for earlier parameters in order to specify values for later 
        parameters. In order to omit parameters that require a value, you can use '' for string parameters and 0 for numeric parameters.
    </p>
    <p>Browsers place a limit on the number and size of cookies allowed per website. Some browsers start deleting old cookies after 20 cookies
        have been set, and others start rejecting new cookies after 50 cookies have been set. Browsers also enforce a maximum combined size for
        all websites, so a particularly cookie-heavy website may delete cookies from your own site. As such, cookies should be used sparingly.
    </p>
    <h2>PHP Sessions</h2>
    <p>Cookies are inappropriate for storing large amounts of data. For example, if an e-commerce site uses cookies in order to store a visitor's
        cart, the larger the order is, the more likely it will clash with the browser's cookie limitations. PHP sessions were developed to solve
        this issue. Instead of storing all data as cookies, sessions allow you to store data in the web server. The only thing that is stored in 
        the browser is a cookie containing the visitor's unique session ID. This variable is what the site's PHP watches for on subsequent page
        requests, and uses it to load the stored data associated with that session.
    </p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified, a PHP session automatically sets a cookie in the user's browser that contains the session ID. The browser
        sends that cookie, as well as every other request for a page within the site, so that the PHP can determine the potentially numerous 
        sessions in progress that the requests belong to. Using a set of temporary files that are stored on the web server, PHP keeps track of
        the variables that have been registered in each session, as well as their values.
    </p>
    <p>Before using the session-management features in PHP, you should ensure that the relevent section of your php.ini file has been set up
        properly. If you're using an all-in-one package like XAMPP or MAMP, or a server that belongs to your web host, you can usually assume that
        this has been done for you. Otherwise, you need to open your php.ini file and look for the section marked [Section]. Beneath it, you will
        find about 20 options. You'll want to check the session.save_handler, session.save_path, and session.use_cookies options.
    </p>
    <p>To tell PHP to look for a session ID, or to start a new session, you simply call the session_start() function. If an existing session ID
        is found when this function is called, PHP restores the variables that belong to that session. Since this function attempts to create a
        cookie, it must come before any page content is sent to the browser, just as we saw for setcookie.
    </p>
    <p>To create a session variable that will be available on all pages in the site when accessed by the current user, set a value in the
        special $_SESSION array. For example, the following variable will store a variable called 'password' in the current session:
        $_SESSION['password'] = 'mypassword'; <br>
        To remove a variable from the current session, use PHP's unset function: unset($_SESSION['password']);<br>
        If you want to end the session and delete all registered variables in the process, clear all stored values and use session_destroy:
        $_SESSION = array(); session_destroy();
    </p>
    <h2>Access Control</h2>
    <p>One of the most common reasons for building a database-driven website is that it allows the site owner to update the site from any web
        browser. However, because there are hackers, you also need to consider the security of your administration pages. Requiring username
        and password authentication is the most basic forms of securing an administration area. There are two ways to do this: configuring your
        web server software to require a valid login for the relevant pages, or using PHP to prompt the user to check the login credentials as
        appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>If you have access to your web server's configuration, the first option is often the easiest to set up, but the second option is far more
        flexible. With PHP, you can develop your own login form, even embed it into the layout of the site if you want. PHP also makes it easy to
        change the credentials required to gain access, or manage a database of authorized users, each with their own credentials and privileges.
    </p>
    <p>Access control is best accomplished using a Model-View-Controller approach.</p>
    <h2>Canvas API</h2>
    <p>The HTML Canvas API allows us to use Javascript to draw on the webpage. This can improve site performance by reducing the need to retrieve
        images off the network. Canvas can be used to modify images and videos, as well as draw on the page.
    </p>
    <p>The first step to using this API is creating a canvas element using the '< canvas >' '< /canvas >' tags (without the spaces). You can then
    access the canvas by using DOM manipulation.</p>
    <p>You then need to set up the canvas context. This is where the drawing is rendered. You can do this by calling the getContext method, like
        this: let context = canvas.getContext('2d')
    </p>
    <p>In order to paint the canvas, you need to assign properties to the canvas. For example, strokeStyle colors the border of the shape you want
        to draw, and fillStyle colors the interior of the shape. Drawing a rectangle might look something like this:
    </p>
    <p>var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");<br>
        var context = canvas.getContext("2d");<br>
        context.strokeStyle = "red";<br>
        context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)";<br>
        context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100);<br>
        context.strokeRect(10, 10, 100, 100);</p>
    <p>Canvas operates on a coordinate system. The top left corner is 0,0 and the bottom right is the maximum number of pixels on the canvas. For
        example, if the canvas was 200 x 200 pixels, the bottom right corner would be 200,200. 
    </p>
    <p>You can use CanvasGradient or CanvasPattern in order to fill a shape, too. You can create a CanvasPattern by calling the createPattern 
        method. This method takes two parameters: the image to create the pattern with, and how the image should be repeated. The repeat value is a
        string and is the same as the CSS repeat values.
    </p>
    <p>To create a CanvasGradient, you can either use createRadialGradient or createLinearGradient.</p>
    <p>createLinearGradient's x0 and y0 represent the starting point of a gradient, and x1 and y1 represent the end point. After that, you have to
        specify the color stops via addColorStop. This takes two parameters; offset and color. The offset is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is
        the beginning of the gradient and 1 is the end of the gradient, and the color is a string that can be a color name, hexadecimal value, 
        RGB value, or RGBA value.
    </p>
    <p>You can draw objects that aren't rectangles or squares by using the beginPath method. For example, to draw a circle, you would call beginPath,
        then the signature for the arc method; arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise). It might look something like this:
        context.arc(50, 50, 30, 0, Math.PI*2, true);<br>
        X and Y represent where the arc's path should begin. This is the center of the circle. Radius is the distance from the center of the circle
        to the edge. startAngle and endAngle represent the start and end angles along the circle's circumference that you want to draw.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have a path laid out, you can specify the stroke and fill of the object.</p>
    <p>You can save a canvas drawing by using toDataURL. This creates a URL with an image in it. You can specify the file type to be PNG or JPG.
    </p>
    <p>You can draw an existing image to a canvas by using drawImage with the coordinates you want the image to be at.</p>
    <p>You can manipulate an image by using getImageData. Once you have the image data, you can manipulate the pixels of that image. The 
        getImageData method allows us to examine a small section of the canvas. It takes four parameters, corresponding to the coordinates of
        the section corners. 
    </p>
    <p>There are security errors that come with using getImageData, however, these errors are unnecessary. Chrome and Firefox attempt to stop a
        user on one domain from manipulating images on another domain. Therefore, in order to test pixel manipulation in Chrome and Firefox, you
        will need to either use http://localhost/ or test it online.
    </p>
    <p>We can use a for loop to manipulate the value of each pixel in a section of canvas. In order to change a bunch of pixels to grayscale, for
        example, you might use a for loop like this:<br>
        for (var i = 0; i < imageData.data.length; i += 4)<br>
        {    red = imageData.data[i];    <br>
            green = imageData.data[i + 1];    <br>
            blue = imageData.data[i + 2];    <br>
            grayscale = red * 0.3 + green * 0.59 + blue * 0.11; <br>
            imageData.data[i] = grayscale;     <br>
            imageData.data[i + 1] = grayscale;      <br>
            imageData.data[i + 2] = grayscale;  <br>
        }<br>
        context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
    </p>
    <p>Manipulating video data functions similarly, but you have to iterate through each frame of the video.</p>
    <p>Using a try/catch block, you can display a message on the screen if something goes wrong, like a security error.</p>
    <p>The Canvas API in its current form lacks accessibility. This is something to be aware of when using the API.</p>
    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>SVG stands for scalable vector graphics. This is a file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML (eXtensible 
        Markup Language). Vector graphics are nice because their image quality doesn't change when you scale an image. We can use SVGs to do
        many of the things we can do with canvas, like drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns.
    </p>
    <p>Drawing a circle in SVG is arguably easier than drawing a circle with canvas. The markup would look something like this, without the spaces:<br>
        < svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 400 400" ><br>   
        < circle cx="50" cy="50" r="25" fill="red" /><br>
        < /svg ><br>
        The viewBox attribute defines the starting location, width, and height of the image. The circle element defines a circle, with cx and cy
        being the x and y coordinates of the center of the circle. The radius is represended by r, and fill defines the fill style. To view an
        SVG file, you simply open it via the file menu in any browser that supports SVG.
    </p>
    <p>We can draw rectangles with SVG. The tag for this is < rect >, without the spaces. Its attributes are width, height, x, y, fill, stroke, 
    and stroke width. Creating complicated shapes with SVG requires a lot more code. </p>
    <p>It's significantly easier to use an image editor to help with creating complex SVG images, as opposed to writing all the code for it.</p>
    <p>You can use an opensource Javascript library called Raphaël to make SVG drawing and animating a lot easier. Like with canvas, you can 
        draw images to a container made with Raphaël. 
    </p>
    <p>Canvas is better for pixel manipulation. It is also not able to be accessed via the DOM, which makes it faster. This makes it better for
        when you need to use a lot of animations. SVG has a more complete set of tools and is accessible via the DOM. However, since it is a file
        type, you can't manipulate images the way you can manipulate pixels with canvas. If you need to paint pixels on a screen and have no 
        concerns about the ability to retrieve and modify shapes, canvas is better. If you want to access and change specific assets of your 
        graphics, SVG is more appropriate.
    </p>
    <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
    <p>The Drag and Drop API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what happens when elements are dragged and
        dropped onto other elements of the page. There are several steps you need to do in order to add drag and drop to your page:
        <ol>
            <li>Set the draggable attribute on any HTML you'd like to be draggable (Note: The draggable attribute is <i>NOT</i> a Boolean attribute, 
                so it has to explicitly be set to "true")</li>
            <li>Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements</li>
            <li>Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements you want to accept dropped items</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>DataTransfer objects are one type of object outlines in the Drag and Drop API. These objects allow us to set and get data about the elements
        being dragged. Specifically, DataTransfer lets us define two pieces of information: the type of data we're saving of the draggable element,
        and the value of the data itself.
    </p>
    <p>By default, elements on a page aren't set up to receive dragged items. In order to override the default behavior on a specific element,
        we must stop it from happening. We do this with event listeners. The two events we need to monitor are dragover and drop. Dragover fires
        when you drag an item over an element, and drop fires when you drop an item over it.
    </p>
