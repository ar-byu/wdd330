    <h1>Notes</h1>
        <p>In Javascript, 'this' is used to refer to an object. For example, a function can use 'this' instead of specifying an object
            within the function. Using this method allows for code that's less easy to break. </p>
        <p>An example of using 'this' in Javascript can be seen here: <button id="this-example">Click Me!</button></p>
    <p>The code used to accomplish this is:<br>
        let user = {<br>
        message: "This is an example message!",<br>
        showMessage() {<br>
            alert(this.message);<br>
        }<br>
    }<br>
    const clickMe = document.getElementById("this-example")<br>
    clickMe.addEventListener("click", () => {user.showMessage()})</p>
    <p>Objects are a way to store key-value pairs in one place. From Javascript: Novice to Ninja, 
        "One way to think about an object is that itâ€™s like a dictionary where you look up a property name and see a value. 
        It's like a database of values."
        The previous code example has a simple object; user.</p>
    <p>Objects can be nested within other objects; for example:</p>
    <p>let temples = {<br>
    washington: {name: 'Washington D.C. Temple'},<br>
    philadelphia: {name: 'Philadelphia Temple'},<br>
    palmyra: {name: 'Palmyra New York Temple'},<br>
    }</p>
    <p>There are several special object types like Math, Date, and RegExp.</p>
    <p>In Javascript, you can manipulate an HTML document, or DOM. DOM is often represented by a bunch of nodes for each HTML element. 
        This is a very common method of getting web pages to do things like having functional buttons or basic animations.
    </p>
    <p>The example code from the 'this' demonstration shows an example of DOM manipulation. DOM manipulation can be used for more than
        just buttons, but that's one of the simpler examples.
    </p>
    <p>Event listeners are how Javascript sees how a page is being interacted with. The demo code above contains an event listener
        that triggers a function when the element is clicked, but there are several other event listeners, such as on key presses or
        when the physical screen is interacted with.
    </p>
    <p>Events can stop the default behavior of a key press or tap, but this isn't common or recommended practice.</p>
